# Custom Hashing Algorithm in Python
This Python script implements a custom hashing algorithm that takes an input string, converts it to binary, and applies logical operations to generate a 128-bit hash value. The hash value is returned as a hex string and can be used for secure data transmission and password storage.

#Usage
Clone the repository or download the custom_hash.py file.
Run the script using Python 3.
Enter the string you want to hash when prompted.
The script will output the 128-bit hash value as a hex string.

#Example

$ python custom_hash.py
Enter string to hash: mysecretpassword
Hash value: 86450f2cfa3f945e3c0123a853aa5e2f

#Disclaimer
This custom hashing algorithm is provided as an educational tool and should not be used for production systems without thorough review and testing. This script is not a substitute for industry-standard hash functions such as SHA-256 or bcrypt. Use at your own risk.
